<p>A project simulating an e-commerce that sells Rocketseat's T-Shirts. This project is using NextJS with TypeScript.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this project is to learn the principles of NextJS Front-End Framework, such as SSR (Server Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generating), web performance, routing by directories, and how this tool helps us developers to make pages trackable for browsers bots aiming to improve the SEO.</p>

## Features

Ignite Shop is an e-commerce developed to study NextJS. The main concepts learned are how this framework builds static pages with "getStaticProps", which is a function called by the internal NodeJS server during build time, as well as web optimization.

### 1. Add product to cart

You can add as many products as you want to the cart by clicking on the button with the bag icon or on the product page.

### 2. View product details in product page

When you click on any product on the home page, you are transferred to the product page, which includes the name, description, and price of the shirt. On this page, NextJS catches dynamically the product ID in the URL. With this in hand, a call is made for Stripe API by the "getStaticProps" function, generating static versions of the page and recreating it every two hours.

### 3. Delete product from cart

By opening the cart modal, you can browse the products you added to buy. On there, you can delete any product you want.

### 4. Add more ou less product quantity

In the cart modal, there is a product counter where you can increase or decrease the number of shirts of the same type.

### 6. Checkout

When you check out, you are redirected to the Stripe checkout page, where you enter personal and purchase information. Considering this as a test mode, you can add a fake credit card number such as ‚Äú4242 4242 4242 4242‚Äù.

### 7. Success page

If the purchase information is correct and there's nothing wrong with it, you are redirected to the success page, where you can find a brief of your purchase.

## Requirements to run the project

<p>Before you run the project, check if you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine, as well [Git](https://git-scm.com) to clone this repository.</p>

## Running the application

<p>Before you run the application, read the docs of Stripe Library and create an account to proceed with this project.</p>

```bash
    # Clone this repository on your machine:
    $ git clone https://github.com/vitorlinsbinski/ignite-shop.git

    # Access the project folder in your terminal:
    $ cd ignite-shop

    # Install all dependencies:
    $ npm install

    # Run the application:
    $ npm run dev
```

<p>After this, go to "developers" and generate the public and the private API keys. Then, put these API keys in the format of environment variables, creating a file called ".env.local" in the project root folder, containing "PUBLIC_KEY" and "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY". Additionally, you must create a variable called "NEXT_URL", which receives the URL where the project is hosted, that is, on localhost in development mode. </p>

<p>So, create products on the Stripe page containing name, description, image, and price.</p>
